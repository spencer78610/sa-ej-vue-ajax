## Description

The Portfolio Projects Vue.js assignment aims to develop a dynamic portfolio website where users can view and explore various projects. Key features of this assignment include implementing components for different sections such as project showcase, about me, contact information, etc. Additionally, it demonstrates Vue.js concepts like routing, state management, and component reusability. The API for fetching project data is accessed locally using Lumen.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spencer78610/sa-ej-vue-ajax.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd sa-ej-vue-ajax
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Ensure that you have PHP installed on your machine. You can download it from [the official PHP website](https://www.php.net/downloads).

5. Set up your Lumen environment. You can follow the official [Lumen documentation](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation) for installation instructions.

6. Configure your Lumen application to serve as the API for the portfolio projects. You can use the provided `portfolio-projects-api` directory as the base for your Lumen application.

7. Run your Lumen application. Make sure it is accessible at a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

## Usage

Once you've installed the dependencies and set up your Lumen environment, you can run the project using the following command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start a development server, and you can view the portfolio website by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080` (or another port if 8080 is in use).

You can also use the application WAMP or MAMP (for windows and mac respectively) to create a local server on your system.
